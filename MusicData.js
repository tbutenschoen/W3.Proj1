//In this file you will declare three classes (object templates)

//1. Declare a class called Song, it's constructor should take three parameters: title, artist, album
class Song {
  constructor(title, artist, album) {
    (this.title = title), (this.artist = artist), (this.album = album);
  }
}

//2. Declare a class called Musician, it's constructor should take three parameters: name, instrument, genre

class Musician {
  constructor(name, instrument, genre) {
    (this.name = name), (this.instrument = instrument), (this.genre = genre);
  }
}

//3. Declare a class called Playlist, it's constructor should take four parameters: name, song1, song2, song3, song4
class Playlist {
  constructor(name, song1, song2, song3) {
    (this.name = name),
      (this.song1 = song1),
      (this.song2 = song2),
      (this.song3 = song3);
  }

  getInfo() {
    console.log(`The playlist 'Top Down Tuesday' has the following songs:
    ${this.song1.title} by ${this.song1.artist.name},
    ${this.song2.title} by ${this.song2.artist.name}, &
    ${this.song3.title} by ${this.song3.artist.name}.`);
  }
}

export { Song, Musician, Playlist };

//4. this class should also define a method called getInfo() that prints text to the console saying
//  The playlist (whatever name you gave it) has the following songs:
//         (Song1 name) by (Song1 Artist Name),
//         (Song2 name) by (Song2 Artist Name),
//         (Song3 name) by (Song3 Artist Name),

//5. export all three classes to make them available to the other JS files.
